This short presentation demonstrates the possibilities for optimizing document management, namely:
- checking the correctness of file names,
- checking for duplicates,
- reading data from file names for further processing,
- reading specifications for further processing and checking the data for errors.
This example, developed by me independently, serves as the basis for the automated integration of design documentation into production processes.
